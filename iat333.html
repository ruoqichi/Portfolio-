        The Vancouver chapter is interested in the retention of females in technical roles. Currently,
        they aim to host events quarterly to carry out their mission in the local tech community.
        They do this by hosting events such as hackathons, panels, and workshops
        every quarter.

        Girls in Tech Vancouver’s Event Coordinator our attention to that there
         is a lack of interaction both before and after the events. By not
         interacting with members outside of events, it can lead to low engagement,
         member confusion, and not getting value.

        Facilitating in-person connections between people during events was both
         limiting and not feasible due to the lack of control. Pursuing this insight
         would to a surface level solution that would not address core concerns found

        Member data shows that students from UBC, SFU, and BCIT make up the majority of
        Girls in Tech Vancouver’s membership base. From this data, we concluded that our
        target audience would be senior Vancouver University students in computer science,
         data science, or design who are looking to bridge the gap between their education
         and the practices of the local tech industry.

       One of the biggest topics we wanted to explore with our film is
       how terrifying technology can be, and how easily it can affect
        one’s life and in this case; ruin it. As technology is the
       biggest theme of the film, I wanted our deck slides to correlate that.

       We knew we wanted to make the viewer uncomfortable, and unsettled.
       To express this, we chose to shoot close up shots of the antagonist
       and to tell the story with the set and minimal dialogue.

     <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
      In my personal opinion, editing is the most important part of a film.
      I believe even with footage that is shot poorly, you can still save it
      with good editing. My team and I had shot more than 100 minutes of footage,
      and it was my job to find usable footage and to cut it all down to 5 minutes.
      Days before, we purposely tried out different shots so we can experiment
      with different angles and perspectives.
     </p>
     <h6 class="iat333-desc-title content-margin">Reflection</h6>
     <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
    Although this project was extremely stressful, I am very proud of the outcome.
    It was my first experience with shooting a film, and I learned so much about
    lighting and editing. Before this project, I was already familiar with editing
     on programs such as After Effects, however, picking the right 5 minutes out of
     100+ minutes of footage and trying to make sense of the different shots was a
     completely different challenge and experience.
