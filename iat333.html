           IAT 333: Interaction Design Methods is a third-year program that introduces
           design methods for interaction design. Through 14 weeks of design ethnography
           and user journey research, personas, participatory workshops and prototyping
           my team and I created TechConnect for Girls in Tech Vancouver.

        They do this by hosting events such as hackathons, panels, and workshops
        every quarter.

         is a lack of interaction both before and after the events. By not

     This project was my first experience with User Research and UX Design.
     After many hours in the studio with my team, we were able to create
     and design a product that we all believed in. Personally, this
     project is extremely special to me as it helped me find an
     area in design that I am truly passionate about.
     Reflecting back on our professor's feedback, we could have
     improved our video by making it more realistic.
