          IAT 235 is a second-year program that introduces the theory and practice
          of designing visual representations of information. The final assignment
          is an educational website with the purpose to be informative, visually
          pleasing, easy to navigate, and responsive on large screens.

          My teammate and I chose the topic of the current dairy industry and the
          exploitation of cows. However, part of the challenge was to keep everything i
          nformative and unbiased as opposed to attacking the industry. View the site <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~rca92/iat%20235/FinalProject/">here.</a>

        <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
          The audience our site aims to attract are ordinary people who don’t need to
          learn how to read scholarly articles, while still being concerned about where
          their food comes from. Below is a persona that I created to help the team
          understand what we wanted to achieve:

        <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
          To achieve this, the site had to be easy to navigate, well organized, and void
          of complicated wording and graphs.  This ensures that the site is easy to
          understand for everyone, which helps in keeping the interest and attention of our users.

        <h6 class="iat235-desc-title content-margin"> Art Direction </h6>
        <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
          Unlike most educational sites that are filled with paragraphs and paragraphs
          of dull information, my teammate and I had to strategize a way to keep the
          site interesting while being able to educate the user. To achieve this, we
          had to find a visual style that was unique. One of the biggest inspirations
          of the site’s visual design is https://umwelt-schweiz.ch/de. My teammate
          and I took inspiration from the site's mix of real photographs and flat
          graphics. Some examples of these are shown below.

          At first, we chose a monochromatic colour scheme. However, we realized we
          needed to add a brighter and distinct colour to use to emphasize things:

          The biggest challenge of the site was designing an infographic that
          represented the process of the dairy industry both accurately and in
          a way that is visually pleasing. Our first attempt was to display a simple
          cycle. However, we underestimated the complexity of the process and
          failed to make sense with the initial graph.

        <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
          <br>
          We realized we had to completely abandon the old design and rethink the process.
          Previously, we were  limited by the idea of the graph has to be a cycle.
          Coming up with a new infographic that was both accurate, visually pleasing,
          and easy to follow was extremely challenging. First, we abandoned the old design
          completely. After doing more depth research on the system of the dairy industry
          and looking at how other designers represented complicated systems with infographics,
          we were able to come up with a new dynamic infographic.

        <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
          My teammate and I were extremely happy with the final product, we thought
          it was accurate and the biggest improvement from the old iteration. We
          decided that the best way to represent the information was to split
          the graph into two with male and female. Unlike the old iteration,
          the new one had time stamps and showed both male and female sides.
          We were even able to include the old repeating cycle.

        <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
          This project was my first experience with developing and designing a website.
          I learned how to use tools and technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          and Axure, as well as new skills such as information design.
          If I could do anything differently, it would definitely be to consider
          the responsivity of the site,  so as to implement a mobile version as well.
