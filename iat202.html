        <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
          IAT 202: New Media Images that explores the computational nature of
          technology as applied to contemporary art and design. The final
          assignment is a student short film, in teams of 4-5.
          Teams were expected to write, shoot, edit and produce it.
        </p>
        <h6 class="iat235-desc-title content-margin"> The Writing Process</h6>
        <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
          The writing process was one of the most difficult parts of the
           project, our team wanted to write something original with themes
           that have not yet been explored in other short films. This took
           several days of brainstorm, and together we were able
           to write a script with everyone’s input.
        </p>

        <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
          After completing the script, we created a shot list and then
          translated that to a storyboard where we figured out the settings
           and shots we wanted. Creating a storyboard helped us create a
           visual image of what the film could look like.

         "An unsettling thriller that follows a psychologically damaged
         man who tries to sabotage the life of his distanced friend.
         Through the use of hacking and psychological manipulation,
         the situation quickly turns grim."

       <h6 class="iat235-desc-title content-margin"> Art Direction </h6>
       <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
         As the art director of the film, I took inspiration from
         shows such as Bandersnatch and Mr. Robot. Both of these films
         had relevant topics and themes that inspired the film’s
          tones and lighting. Below is a mood board I designed
          to further help my team and I  figure out what kind of
         lighting, set and shots we needed.

       <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
         The set was largely inspired by Bandersnatch, with the walls
          filled with papers and pictures. We tried our best to recreate it.

       <h6 class="iat235-desc-title content-margin"> Terrifying Technology </h6>
       <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
         One of the biggest topics we wanted to explore with our film is
         how terrifying technology can be, and how easily it can affect
          one’s life and in this case; ruin it. As technology is the
         biggest theme of the film, I wanted our deck slides to correlate that.

         We knew we wanted to make the viewer uncomfortable, and unsettled.
         To express this, we chose to shoot close up shots of the antagonist
         and to tell the story with the set and minimal dialogue.

       <h6 class="iat235-desc-title content-margin">Editing </h6>
       <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
        In my personal opinion, editing is the most important part of a film.
        I believe even with footage that is shot poorly, you can still save it
        with good editing. My team and I had shot more than 100 minutes of footage,
        and it was my job to find usable footage and to cut it all down to 5 minutes.
        Days before, we purposely tried out different shots so we can experiment
        with different angles and perspectives.
       </p>
       <h6 class="iat235-desc-title content-margin">Reflection</h6>
       <p class="iat235-paragraphs content-margin">
      Although this project was extremely stressful, I am very proud of the outcome.
      It was my first experience with shooting a film, and I learned so much about
      lighting and editing. Before this project, I was already familiar with editing
       on programs such as After Effects, however, picking the right 5 minutes out of
       100+ minutes of footage and trying to make sense of the different shots was a
       completely different challenge and experience.
