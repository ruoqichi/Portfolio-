         <h6 class="iat333-desc-title content-margin"> Context </h6>
         <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
           <a href ="https://copilotai.com/"> CoPilot AI </a> is a SaaS company based in Vancouver, Canada. The company’s mission
           is to fundamentally change the way people connect with businesses.
           <br>
           <br>
           At CoPilot AI, I worked with the Marketing Team as a Communications Designer.
           Within the 4 months that I worked at CoPilot AI, I worked on a wide range of
           different projects including designing Facebook Ads, EBooks, Social Media Content,
           Internal Material, and Website related projects.
         </p>

      <h6 class="iat333-desc-title content-margin"> Overview </h6>
      <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
        Although the current CoPilot AI Website did it’s intended job of informing
        users of our product, services, and generating leads, the Team felt that
        both the visual design, copy, and user journey could be improved. Our
        goal with the redesign was to provide the user with a simple
        frictionless user journey, along with updating the visual design
        to be more modern and clean, with the ultimate goal of increasing leads.
      </p>

      <h6 class="iat333-desc-title content-margin"> Scope and Responsibilities</h6>
      <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
        My primary responsibilities were creating the visual elements that were
        needed for the site and to complement the copy provided for me. Along
        with that, I created Figma prototypes (See Figure 1) that helped the
        team visualize and test out ideas.
      </p>

      <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">

      <h6 class="iat333-desc-title content-margin"> Process </h6>
      <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
        After one of our initial meetings,I created a sitemap (See Figure. 3) that we would follow based on our discussion
        during the meeting.
      </p>

      <h6 class="iat333-desc-title content-margin"> Visual/Graphics Design </h6>
      <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
        The graphics of the site was my main responsibility, and it was important to
        represent the copy accurately.
        <br>
        <br>
        Before beginning to work on the site, I looked into other Saas company websites
        for inspiration before sharing them with my team, one of them being Zendesk.
        The team really liked Zendesk’s clean interface and the way they created
        simple graphical elements based on their product (See Figure 3).
        After this discussion, it gave me a starting point to start thinking
        about what we were looking for in our own visual design.
        </p>

      <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
      After being given the copy by my team, the next step was to mockup
      rough drafts of the site and visuals (See figure. 4)
      to show my team, and to communicate my ideas on how to organize the
      information and in order to receive feedback.

      <p class="captions-img content-margin"> Figure 4: Rough mockups of how we planned to organize the information for the home page along with the graphical elements.</p>

      <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
      After this step, it was a back and forth between me and my team regarding their feedback on the concept,
      and it was my job to take them into consideration and come up with a new solution. An example of this
      process can be found in the first graphical element I created for the homepage, with the concept being
      “Hand pick your audience”.
      <br>
      <br>
      My initial idea for this was to have a group of  illustrated people, along with a mouse that picks
      out the ones that matched the user’s criteria (See Figure 5).
      </p>
      <img src="images/handpickyouraudience.gif" class="responsive-img iat235-landing-mockup-img" style="width:100%" >
      <p class="captions-img content-margin"> Figure 5: First high-fidelity  version of the graphic for “Hand pick your audience”.</p>

      <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
      However I felt that the initial concept wasn’t representing our product accurately. The issue was that it portrayed the process
      as though the user was doing the process manually, when our product was actually doing the work for them after they had selected their
       desired criteria. After discussing this with my teammate, we agreed on the new concept I came up with (See Figure 6).
      </p>
      <img src="images/handpickyouraudience (2).gif" class="responsive-img iat235-landing-mockup-img" style="width:100%" >
      <p class="captions-img content-margin"> Figure 6: Final version for “Hand pick your audience”, my team advised me to use images of real people instead of icons.</p>
      <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
      Although the new concept was still abstract, it resembled and illustrated the real process much more accurately and highlighted
      the efficiency of our product. The abstractness is what we aimed for in the homepage because we believed that the homepage’s
      goal was to engage the user. Meanwhile, on the Features page you can find graphics that are less abstract and resemble the product more.
     <br>
     <br>
     The rest of the graphics on our other webpages (<a href ="https://copilotai.com/atf-gif/"> HomePage </a>, <a href ="https://copilotai.com/features/"> Features </a>, <a href ="https://copilotai.com/how-it-works/"> How It Works </a>, <a href ="https://copilotai.com/packages/">Packages </a>, <a href ="https://copilotai.com/whitelabel-linkedin-lead-generation/">Whitelabel </a>) followed the same process.

      </p>

      <h6 class="iat333-desc-title content-margin">Challenges</h6>
      <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
      During this project, I definitely faced many challenges during the process I illustrated above.
      It was difficult to take into consideration everyone’s feedback and still follow through with my own ideas
      and decisions. However, my team was extremely supportive and always provided insightful ideas and
      supported me in my decisions.
      </p>

      <h6 class="iat333-desc-title content-margin">Takeaways</h6>
      <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
      This was the biggest and most rewarding project that I have worked on at CoPilot AI. This project taught
      me to design for an older age group, which I wasn’t used to. I was also able to learn a lot from my team
      who had expertise in marketing, and taught me to design for other considerations such as how to capture
      the user’s attention, keep them engaged, and tell them enough about our product in order for them to book a demo.
      <br>
      <br>
      It was my first time designing something that would be taken in by so many people, and I look forward to
      seeing what difference it will make. You can check out the site here.

     <h6 class="iat333-desc-title content-margin">The Next Step</h6>
     <p class="iat333-paragraphs content-margin">
      This project is still in process, the team wants to continue revamping the entire company website such
      as the “Sectors” section.
      <br>
      <br>
      Data of whether the website redesign will increase our conversion rate wil be provided once gathered.
